2. K8s - Creating a Cluster
3. K8s - Join a machine to the Cluster


First verify the [Prequisites](./00 Prequisites.md) by creating 3 machines with Docker and K8s installed [Nodes installation](01 Installation.md). Then on one machine install the cluster [Creating a Cluster](02 Clusters.md). When the cluster is installed and configured, join the 2 other machines to the cluster [Join a machine to the Cluster](03 Join Machines.md).
